Problem Statement
Food & Beverages Spend Prediction in Club Mahindra Resorts

Club Mahindra (Club M) makes significant revenue from Food and Beverages (F&B) sales in their resorts. The members of Club M are offered a wide variety of items in either buffet or Ã€ la carte form. Following are some benefits that the model to predict the spend by a member in their next visit to a resort will bring:

- Predicting the F&B spend of a member in a resort would help in improving the pre-sales during resort booking through web and mobile app
- Targeted campaigns to suit the member taste and preference of F&B
- Providing members in the resort with a customized experience and offers
- Help resort kitchen to plan the inventory and food quantity to be prepared in advance
